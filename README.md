# pysslShells
Finally, reverse/bind shells written in python, encrypted with ssl!

### Updated (October 25th, 2019)

- Ported server code to python3 (payload works with either python2 or python3)
- Fixed a bunch of errors and glitches
- Better logic for creating and managing ssl keys
- TODO: Write bind shell



Tips are super appreciated ...
